When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when you want to share with others or share with your other computers
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Sometimes you are working on something not the same as what's on GitHub, pulling changes automatically may destroy your work.
